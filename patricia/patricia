- divergences are binary, thats why we only need to store the first 
  differing bit of the branch

- patricia is radix with r=2

- only terminal nodes hold val, a copy of the entire path to that node
  (key), the others store a nullptr. That is necessary bc we can see how
  path compression alone could allow for false positives like:

	100000 -> goes to branch 0
	100100 -> goes to branch 1

	without value 100001 would incorrectly evalueate true for 100000
	
- due to [path compression we can see that early returns are not possible

- due to path compression we can see suffic search becomes hard or
  impossible as it would require us to store values on every node, defeating
  patricia's main objective

- prefix search is really hard as it would require visiting all (or enough
  until we find a match) leaf nodes branching from that node
